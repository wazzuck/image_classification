I have created the following files inside the image_classification directory:

- README.md: Contains step-by-step instructions for building the classifier.
- requirements.txt: Lists the necessary Python packages.
- dataset.py: Includes comments and pseudocode for creating the MNIST dataset loader.
- model.py: Includes comments and pseudocode for defining the Transformer classifier model.
- train.py: Includes comments and pseudocode for the training and validation loop.
- evaluate.py: Includes comments and pseudocode for evaluating a trained model.

You can now follow the instructions in the README.md and fill in the actual 
Python code in the .py files based on the provided pseudocode. 
Let me know if you need help with implementing any specific part!
